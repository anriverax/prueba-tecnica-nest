# NestJS Project with MongoDB Atlas and Cloudinary

This project is built with NestJS and integrates MongoDB Atlas for database storage and Cloudinary for media management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Node.js installed on your machine
2. A MongoDB Atlas account
3. A Cloudinary account

## Setting up MongoDB Atlas

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. Create a new cluster (you can use the free tier for development).
3. Once your cluster is created, click on "Connect" and choose "Connect your application".
4. Copy the connection string. It should look something like this:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
5. Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas username, password, and desired database name.

## Setting up Cloudinary

1. Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. Once logged in, navigate to your dashboard.
3. You'll find your account details including:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

## Environment Variables

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

Replace the values with your actual MongoDB and Cloudinary credentials.
